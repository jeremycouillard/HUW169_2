## Synopsis

Game Demo files from class examples for HUW169 - Game Design at LaGuardia Community College.

## What this is

These are the examples we went over at class. You can download them, break them, reconfigure them however you want in order to learn how they work. Everything is well commented. 

## How to use

Download as a zip file. Then you can put any of the .uasset files from my content folder into the content folder of your project to play around with them. Or you can open my .uproject file to see everything there.
